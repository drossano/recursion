# Recursion

This project is part of the Ruby path of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/https:/). The goal of this project is to create two methods using recursion:

* `fibs_rec` - Returns the given amount of digits in the fibonacci sequence.
* `merge_sort` - Sorts a given array using merge sorting.
